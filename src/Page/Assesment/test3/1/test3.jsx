              One of the most important roles for a foot specialist is their
              ability to perform a thorough assessment of their patient to
              determine what may be causing the foot complaint and how to
              develop the proper treatment plan.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your assessment will involve the foot specialist analyzing the
              dermatological, vascular, neurological and musculoskeletal aspects
              of your foot. Based on their assessment findings, along with a
              detailed history of your foot complaint, the foot specialist will
              be able to create a unique patient centred treatment plan for you.
              If you have a foot complaint, you donâ€™t have to suffer all on your
              own. Please go visit a foot specialist to get professional advice
              and treatment.
